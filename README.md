Applying to college can be overwhelming. College Organizer hopes to make the whole process a little easier by tracking the colleges about which students feel confident and those they don't. Students can search through the top 370+ colleges and universities in the country, view important admissions criteria particular to each college, and add the schools to their Safety, Target, and Reach lists in an effort to keep track of their searches and stay organized. Because there is no available API with this information, the data was compiled from various sources and entered into the database manually.
